    subhead: Decentralized Reflections on Consensus
    body: >
      Consensus is at the heart of decentralised systems, having taken centre
      stage with the introduction of Nakamoto’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm
      and the subsequent explosion of blockchain technology. However, it also
      poses a significant scalability bottleneck for blockchain networks. The
      goal of this workshop is to present different scalability approaches being
      pursued across different projects, and foster new ideas and
      collaborations.

        text: >
          Before joining Protocol Labs, Alfonso de la Rocha worked as a
          blockchain expert at Telefónica R\&D, where he was responsible for the
          design and development of core technology based on blockchains,
          distributed systems, and advanced cryptography. Alfonso’s involvement
          in research and development began at Universidad Politécnica de
          Madrid, where he worked on topics related to energy efficiency in data
          centers. His broad R\&D experience also includes research into the
          compression efficiency of video coding standards at Ericsson Research
          and projects related to securing interdomain routing protocols at KTH
          Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Alfonso is also an avid
          reader and basketball lover.

          **Sebastian Nagel** is an Austrian software engineer and functional
          programming enthusiast. He studied computer science and graduated from
          the Technical University of Munich with a master's degree in robotics,
          cognition and intelligence. Within the robotics industry, he got to
          know and love Haskell, formal methods, domain-specific languages, and
          interpreters. After several years creating robot programming
          languages, development platforms, and internet of things projects at
          Franka Emika, Sebastian joined IOHK in 2021. In his time off he
          usually roams the Alps climbing rock and ice.

          **Sergio Mena** obtained a PhD in Distributed Systems from EPFL
          (Switzerland) in 2006. Before, he followed EPFL's Graduate School in
          Computer Science programme in 2001, and finished MSc (1999) and BSc
          (1996) in Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Valencia
          (UPV, Spain). He worked as a teaching fellow at the University of York
          (UK), and as a software engineer at Cisco (~12 years), where he
          contributed to the research of congestion control algorithms.
          Currently, he works as a research engineer at Informal Systems. His
          research interests include fault-tolerant distributed systems, and
          congestion control for real time media.
